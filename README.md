## About Me!

![](https://github.com/emilycoplin/emilycoplin.github.io/blob/master/mepic.jpg?raw=true)

My name is Emily Coplin and I am a first year student in the College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh University.

I grew up in Newark, New Jersey and I have lived here all my life. Although I love New Jersey and my community, I have big dreams to travel the world and explore different cultures. My ultimate goal is to travel to Italy and learn about their culture. When I am not in school, some of my hobbies include painting and listening to music. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends on the weekends.
