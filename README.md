## About Me!

![](https://github.com/emilycoplin/emilycoplin.github.io/blob/master/mepic.jpg?raw=true)

My name is Emily Coplin and I am a first year student in the College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh University.

I grew up in Newark, New Jersey and I have lived here all my life. Although I love New Jersey and my community, I have big dreams to travel the world and explore different cultures and my ultimate goal is to travel to Italy. When I am not in school, some of my hobbies include painting and listening to music. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends on the weekends.

## Work Experience!

Some of my work experience includes internships at the Greater Newark Conservancy and BlackRock. The Greater Newark Conservancy was a non-profit organization dedicated to distributing healthy and fresh food to several communities. And the BlackRock Summer Excellence Internship was a program for students to learn about businesses and gain some experience as to what it is like to be a part of a business.

## Academics!

Throughout high school, I joined several clubs and extracurricular activities in order to discover new things that I enjoyed. This included National Honors Society in which we focused on community service and ways to give back, Arts Society where we designed clothes and learned how to do makeup, and Six String Companion where I learned to play guitar.

I also took a total of nine advanced placement classes and explored many options as to what I would like to major in once I get to college and what career I would choose when I'm older. This included a wide range of humanities and STEM courses. I am currently undecided in my major, however, I am interested in both design and architecture. Despite these specific interests, I still want to go through college exploring my many possibilities and enjoy them.
