## About Me!

![](https://github.com/emilycoplin/emilycoplin.github.io/blob/master/mepic.jpg?raw=true)

My name is Emily Coplin and I am a first year student in the College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh University.

I grew up in Newark, New Jersey and I have lived here all my life. Although I love New Jersey and my community, I have big dreams to travel the world and explore different cultures and my ultimate goal is to travel to Italy. When I am not in school, some of my hobbies include painting and listening to music. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends on the weekends. For my first semester at Lehigh, I chose to take Data Journalism because I took a Statistics class in high school, so I wanted to use this knowledge and apply it to writing data stories.

## Work Experience!

Some of my work experience includes internships at the Greater Newark Conservancy and BlackRock. The Greater Newark Conservancy was a non-profit organization dedicated to distributing healthy and fresh food to several communities. And the BlackRock Summer Excellence Internship was a program for students to learn about businesses and gain some experience as to what it is like to be a part of a business.

## Academics!

Throughout high school, I joined several clubs and extracurricular activities in order to discover new things that I enjoyed. This included National Honors Society in which we focused on community service and ways to give back, Arts Society where we designed clothes and learned how to do makeup, and Six String Companion where I learned to play guitar.

I also took a total of nine advanced placement classes and explored many options as to what I would like to major in once I get to college and what career I would choose when I'm older. This included a wide range of humanities and STEM courses. I am currently undecided in my major, however, I am interested in both design and architecture. Despite these specific interests, I still want to go through college exploring my many possibilities and enjoy them.

# Percent of Adults Aged 18 Years and Older Who Have Obesity in the U.S.

This inforgraphic shows the total percentage of adults from the age of 18 and over, who are obese, starting from the year 2011 up until the year 2018. This information comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, part of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The data demonstrates a steady increase in the obesity rate among adults, with obesity being defined as the condition of abnormal fat accumulation that presents a risk to one's health. This increase in obesity rates among adults, could be a result of the increase in fast food restaurants around the nation, that ultimately encourages the consumption of fatty and unhealthy foods, demonstrating a possible correlational relationship between the two.

# US Undergraduate Enrollment Numbers by Ethnicity in 2018

This bar chart shows the total percentage of enrolled undergraduate students based on ethnicity from the year 2018. This data comes from educationdata.org. Based on this data, we see that a majority of college students are white, while minorities take up a lower percentage. This could be a result of poverty among minority people, who struggle to find the money and opportunities to attend college.
