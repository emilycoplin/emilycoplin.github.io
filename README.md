## About Me!

![](https://github.com/emilycoplin/emilycoplin.github.io/blob/master/mepic.jpg?raw=true)

My name is Emily Coplin and I am a first year student in the College of Arts and Sciences at Lehigh University.

I grew up in Newark, New Jersey and I have lived here all my life. Although I love New Jersey and my community, I have big dreams to travel the world and explore different cultures. My ultimate goal is to travel to Italy and learn about their culture. When I am not in school, some of my hobbies include painting and listening to music. I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends on the weekends.

Some of my work experience includes internships at the Greater Newark Conservancy and BlackRock. The Greater Newark Conservancy was a non-profit organization dedicated to distributing healthy and fresh food to several communities. And the BlackRock Summer Excellence Internship was program for students to learn about businesses and gain some experience as to what it is like to be a part of a business.

Throughout high school, I took a total of nine advanced placement classes and explored many options as to what I would like to major in once I get to college and what career I would choose when I'm older. I am currently undecided in my major, hoowever, I am interested in both design and architecture. Despite these specific interests, I still want to go through college exploreing my many possibilities and enjoy them.
